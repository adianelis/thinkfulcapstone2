Thinkful Capstone 2: Supervised Learning

First: Go out and find a dataset of interest. It could be from one of our recommended resources, some other aggregation, or scraped yourself. Just make sure it has lots of variables in it, including an outcome of interest to you.

Second: Explore the data. Get to know the data. Spend a lot of time going over its quirks and peccadilloes. You should understand how it was gathered, what's in it, and what the variables look like.

Third: Model your outcome of interest. You should try several different approaches and really work to tune a variety of models before using the model evaluation techniques to choose what you consider to be the best performer. Make sure to think about explanatory versus predictive power and experiment with both.
